# ta4j

Technical Analysis For Java

Previously forked from peas/tail (http://tail.sourceforge.net/)

***Warning!***
Ta4j gives priority to accuracy over performance, it uses `BigDecimal`s under the hood. So if you are developing a low-latency trading program then **ta4j is not for you**. This may change in the future.



### Indicators

Ta4j includes more than 40 indicators: https://github.com/mdeverdelhan/ta4j/tree/master/src/main/java/eu/verdelhan/ta4j/indicators
